Kirby Posts Chopper
==================

A PHP script that takes a single formatted file of posts and chops them up into files and folders the way Kirby likes them.

Huge thanks to Ed Finkler from Funkatron for [his post](http://funkatron.com/posts/migrating-from-expressionengine-to-jekyll.html) on migrating from ExpressionEngine to Jekyll without which I wouldn't have been able to build this. 

For more on how to use this, check out my blog post [Migrating from ExpressionEngine to Kirby](http://begoodnotbad.com/article/Migrating-from-ExpressionEngine-to-Kirby).
